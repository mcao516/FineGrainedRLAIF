Having scored a record 600 league goals and at least 1468 goals overall, the International Federation of Football History & Statistics (IFFHS) awarded Bican the \"Golden Ball\" as the greatest goalscorer of the last century. He was a member of the Austrian \"Wunderteam\" of the 1930s and was the season's highest scorer in the whole of Europe on five separate occasions. Bican had the ability to play with both feet; he also had considerable pace and was able to run 100 metres in 10.8 seconds, which was as fast as many sprinters of the time. Bican was born in Vienna to Franti\u0161ek and Ludmila Bican. He was the second of three children. Franti\u0161ek was from Sedlice in Southern Bohemia, and Ludmila was Viennese Czech.

Total production numbered around 70,000. Production stopped shortly after the Chrysler takeover of the Rootes Group. The \"Series\" Alpine started production in 1959. One of the original prototypes still survives and was raced by British Touring car champion Bernard Unett. The car made extensive use of components from other Rootes Group vehicles and was built on a modified floorpan from the Hillman Husky estate car.

Although the Technicolor process could \"hide\" the car's true colour, and knowing that the car was shipped back from Monaco to the USA for use in front of a rear projection effect, the car shown on the programme was ultimately proven not to be the film car upon comparison of the vehicle identification numbers.

Ken Howes contributed some 80 per cent of the overall design work, he had worked at Ford before joining Rootes. The Alpine was produced in four subsequent revisions until 1968. Total production numbered around 70,000. Production stopped shortly after the Chrysler takeover of the Rootes Group. The \"Series\" Alpine started production in 1959. One of the original prototypes still survives and was raced by British Touring car champion Bernard Unett. The car made extensive use of components from other Rootes Group vehicles and was built on a modified floorpan from the Hillman Husky estate car. The running gear came mainly from the Sunbeam Rapier, but with front disc brakes replacing the saloon car's drums. An overdrive unit and wire wheels were optional. The suspension was independent at the front using coil springs and at the rear had a live axle and semi-elliptic springing. The Girling-manufactured brakes used discs at the front and drums at the rear. Coup\u00e9 versions of the post-1959 version were built by Thomas Harrington Ltd. After the Le Mans Index of Efficiency success of 1961, Harrington sold replicas as the \"Harrington Le Mans\", using a fastback body and an engine tuned to .",

A true open 2-seater, there were no external door handles or wind-up windows. Very few of these cars are ever seen on the big screen. However, a sapphire blue Alpine featured prominently in the 1955 Alfred Hitchcock film \"To Catch a Thief\" starring Cary Grant and Grace Kelly. More recently, the American PBS show \"History Detectives\" tried to verify that an Alpine roadster owned by a private individual was the actual car used in that movie. Although the Technicolor process could \"hide\" the car's true colour, and knowing that the car was shipped back from Monaco to the USA for use in front of a rear projection effect, the car shown on the programme was ultimately proven not to be the film car upon comparison of the vehicle identification numbers. The first open 2-seater Alpines were based on the Hillman 14 and its successor the Humber Hawk. Rootes replaced them with a softer new smaller 2-seater sports convertible coup\u00e9 based on the current Hillman Minx and its variants.",

The Great Trek resulted from the culmination of tensions between rural descendants of the Cape's original European settlers, known collectively as \"Boers\", and the British Empire. It was also reflective of an increasingly common trend among individual Boer communities to pursue an isolationist and semi-nomadic lifestyle away from the developing administrative complexities in Cape Town. Boers who participated in the Great Trek identified themselves as \"voortrekkers\", meaning \"pioneers\", \"pathfinders\" (literally \"fore-trekkers\") in Dutch and Afrikaans. The Great Trek led directly to the founding of several autonomous Boer republics, namely the South African Republic (also known simply as the \"Transvaal\"), the Orange Free State, and the Natalia Republic.
