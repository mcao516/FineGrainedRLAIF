Backward failure can be subdivided into the failure of the left atrium, the left ventricle or both within the left circuit. The patient will have dyspnea (shortness of breath) on exertion and in severe cases, dyspnea at rest. Increasing breathlessness on lying flat, called orthopnea, occurs. It is often measured in the number of pillows required to lie comfortably, and in orthopnea, the patient may resort to sleeping while sitting up. Another symptom of heart failure is paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea: a sudden nighttime attack of severe breathlessness, usually several hours after going to sleep. Easy fatigability and exercise intolerance are also common complaints related to respiratory compromise. \"Cardiac asthma\" or wheezing may occur. Compromise of left ventricular \"forward\" function may result in symptoms of poor systemic circulation such as dizziness, confusion and cool extremities at rest. Right-sided heart failure is often caused by pulmonary heart disease (cor pulmonale), which is typically caused by difficulties of the pulmonary circulation, such as pulmonary hypertension or pulmonic stenosis. | wikipage: Heart failure text: The left side of the heart is responsible for receiving oxygen-rich blood from the lungs and pumping it forward to the systemic circulation (the rest of the body except for the pulmonary circulation). Failure of the left side of the heart causes blood to back up (be congested) into the lungs, causing respiratory symptoms as well as fatigue due to insufficient supply of oxygenated blood. Common respiratory signs are increased rate of breathing and increased \"work\" of breathing (non-specific signs of respiratory distress). Rales or crackles, heard initially in the lung bases, and when severe, throughout the lung fields suggest the development of pulmonary edema (fluid in the alveoli). Cyanosis which suggests severe low blood oxygen, is a late sign of extremely severe pulmonary edema. Additional signs indicating left ventricular failure include a laterally displaced apex beat (which occurs if the heart is enlarged) and a gallop rhythm (additional heart sounds) may be heard as a marker of increased blood flow or increased intra-cardiac pressure.

It originated from a disputed treaty which, the Italians claimed, turned the country into an Italian protectorate. Italy was supported by the two other triple alliance members Germany and Austria-Hungary. Much to their surprise, they found that Ethiopian ruler Menelik II, rather than being opposed by some of his traditional enemies, was supported by them, so the Italian army, invading Ethiopia from Italian Eritrea in 1893, faced a more united front than they expected. In addition, Ethiopia was supported by Russia, an Orthodox Christian nation like Ethiopia with military advisers, army training, and the sale of weapons for Ethiopian forces during the war. Ethiopia was also supported diplomatically by the French in order to prevent Italy from becoming a colonial competitor. Full-scale war broke out in 1895, with Italian troops having initial success until Ethiopian troops counterattacked Italian positions and besieged the Italian fort of Meqele, forcing its surrender. Italian defeat came about after the Battle of Adwa, where the Ethiopian army dealt the heavily outnumbered Italians a decisive blow and forced their retreat back into Eritrea. | wikipage: Second Italo-Ethiopian War text: Second Italo-Ethiopian War\n\nThe Second Italo-Ethiopian War, also referred to as the Second Italo-Abyssinian War, was a colonial war fought from 3 October 1935 until 19 February 1937, although Addis Ababa was captured on 5 May 1936. The war was fought between the armed forces of the Kingdom of Italy and those of the Ethiopian Empire (also known as Abyssinia). Ethiopia was defeated, annexed and subjected to military occupation. The Ethiopian Empire became a part of the Italian colony of Italian East Africa. Fighting continued until the Italian defeat in East Africa in 1941, during the East African Campaign of the Second World War. Italy and Ethiopia were members of the League of Nations yet the League was unable to control Italy or to protect Ethiopia when Italy violated Article X of the Covenant of the League of Nations. The Abyssinia Crisis of 1935 is often seen as a clear demonstration of the ineffectiveness of the League. The Italian victory coincided with the zenith of the popularity of dictator Benito Mussolini and the Fascist regime at home and abroad.

This led to their book, \"Social Learning Theory\", published in 1941, which posited that personality consisted of learned habits. They used Hull's drive theory, where a drive is a need that stimulates a behavioral response, crucially conceiving a drive of imitation, which was positively reinforced by social interaction and widespread as a result. Julian B. Rotter, a professor at Ohio State University published his book, \"Social Learning and Clinical Psychology\" in 1954. His theories moved away from the strictly behaviorist learning of the past, and considered instead the holistic interaction between the individual and the environment. In his theory, the social environment and individual personality created probabilities of behavior, and the reinforcement of these behaviors led to learning.He emphasized the subjective nature of the responses and effectiveness of reinforcement types. | wikipage: Social learning theory text: Social learning theory\n\nSocial Learning Theory is a theory of learning and social behavior which proposes that new behaviors can be acquired by observing and imitating others. It states that learning is a cognitive process that takes place in a social context and can occur purely through observation or direct instruction, even in the absence of motor reproduction or direct reinforcement. In addition to the observation of behavior, learning also occurs through the observation of rewards and punishments, a process known as vicarious reinforcement. When a particular behavior is rewarded regularly, it will most likely persist; conversely, if a particular behavior is constantly punished, it will most likely desist. The theory expands on traditional behavioral theories, in which behavior is governed solely by reinforcements, by placing emphasis on the important roles of various internal processes in the learning individual. In the 1940s, B.F. Skinner delivered a series of lectures in Sunyani Fiapre, Ghana on verbal behavior, putting forth a more empirical approach to the subject than existed in psychology at the time. In them, he proposed the use of stimulus-response theories to describe language use and development, and that all verbal behavior was underpinned by operant conditioning. He did however mention that some forms of speech derived from words and sounds that had previously been heard (echoic response), and that reinforcement from parents allowed these 'echoic responses' to be pared down to that of understandable speech. | wikipage: Albert Bandura text: Albert Bandura\n\nAlbert Bandura (; born December 4, 1925) is a Canadian-American psychologist who is the David Starr Jordan Professor Emeritus of Social Science in Psychology at Stanford University.

As the chorus plays, Brown is seen in a zero-gravity room. Guetta also then seen in the zero-gravity room. Wayne then is seen with a skateboard with a few other skateboarders in the background.",

The film stars J. Michael Finley as Bart Millard, the lead singer who wrote the song about his relationship with his father (Dennis Quaid). Madeline Carroll, Priscilla Shirer, Cloris Leachman, Trace Adkins and Brody Rose also star. \"I Can Only Imagine\" was released in the United States on March 16, 2018. It was a massive box office success, grossing $85 million worldwide against a production budget of $7 million, becoming the fourth highest-grossing music biopic of all-time in the United States. Some critics praised it as inspiring and noted it as an improvement compared to other faith-based films, while others called it flat and by-the-numbers. At the 2018 Dove Awards, the film won \"Inspirational Film of the Year\". 10-year-old Bart Millard lives with his mother and abusive father Arthur in Texas. One day his mother drops him off at a Christian camp where he meets Shannon. Upon his return from camp, Bart finds his mother has left and movers are removing her belongings.",

By 26 January 1926, he demonstrated the transmission of the image of a face in motion by radio. This is widely regarded as the first television demonstration. The subject was Baird's business partner Oliver Hutchinson. Baird's system used the Nipkow disk for both scanning the image and displaying it. A bright light shining through a spinning Nipkow disk set with lenses projected a bright spot of light which swept across the subject. A Selenium photoelectric tube detected the light reflected from the subject and converted it into a proportional electrical signal. This was transmitted by AM radio waves to a receiver unit, where the video signal was applied to a neon light behind a second Nipkow disk rotating synchronized with the first. The brightness of the neon lamp was varied in proportion to the brightness of each spot on the image. As each hole in the disk passed by, one scan line of the image was reproduced. Baird's disk had 30 holes, producing an image with only 30 scan lines, just enough to recognize a human face. In 1927, Baird transmitted a signal over of telephone line between London and Glasgow. | wikipage: History of television text: In 1931, he made the first outdoor remote broadcast, of The Derby. In 1932, he demonstrated ultra-short wave television. Baird's mechanical system reached a peak of 240 lines of resolution on BBC television broadcasts in 1936, though the mechanical system did not scan the televised scene directly. Instead, a 17.5mm film was shot, rapidly developed and then scanned while the film was still wet. An American inventor, Charles Francis Jenkins, also pioneered the television. He published an article on \"Motion Pictures by Wireless\" in 1913, but it was not until December 1923 that he transmitted moving silhouette images for witnesses. On June 13, 1925, Jenkins publicly demonstrated the synchronized transmission of silhouette pictures. In 1925, Jenkins used a Nipkow disk and transmitted the silhouette image of a toy windmill in motion, over a distance of five miles (from a naval radio station in Maryland to his laboratory in Washington, D.C.), using a lensed disk scanner with a 48-line resolution. He was granted U.S. patent 1,544,156 (Transmitting Pictures over Wireless) on June 30, 1925 (filed March 13, 1922). On December 25, 1925, Kenjiro Takayanagi demonstrated a television system with a 40-line resolution that employed a Nipkow disk scanner and CRT display at Hamamatsu Industrial High School in Japan. | wikipage: History of television text: This small tube could amplify a signal reportedly to the 60th power or better and showed great promise in all fields of electronics.

As television technology advanced, more innovations were added to the television system. As such, Manfred von Ardenne gave a public demonstration in August 1931 of a television system using a cathode-ray tube (CRT) for both transmission and reception. On August 25, 1934, Philo Farnsworth gave the world's first public demonstration of an all-electronic television system, using a live camera. This would also coincide with the date when all-electric television were introduced to the general public."

Issued by the State Bank of Vietnam, it is represented by the symbol \"\u20ab\". Formerly, it was subdivided into 10 \"h\u00e0o\", which were further subdivided into 10 \"xu\", neither of which are now used. Since 2012 the use of coins has decreased greatly, and since 2014 coins are generally not accepted in retail, but will still be accepted in some, but not all, banks. The word \u0111\u1ed3ng is from the term \"\u0111\u1ed3ng ti\u1ec1n\" (\"money\"), a loanword from the Chinese \"t\u00f3ng qi\u00e1n\" (Traditional Chinese: \u9285\u9322; Simplified Chinese: \u94dc\u94b1). The term refers to Chinese bronze coins used as currency during the dynastic periods of China and Vietnam. The term \"h\u00e0o\" is a loanword from the Chinese \"h\u00e1o\" (Chinese: \u6beb), meaning a tenth of a currency unit. The term \"xu\" comes from French \"sous\" meaning \"penny\". The sign is encoded . In 1946, the Viet Minh government (later to become the government of North Vietnam) introduced its own currency, the \u0111\u1ed3ng, to replace the French Indochinese piastre at par. | wikipage: Vietnamese \u0111\u1ed3ng text: Two revaluations followed, in 1951 and 1958; the first was at a rate of 100:1, the second at a rate of 1,000:1. <nowiki> </nowiki> \n\nNotes dually denominated in piastres and \u0111\u1ed3ng were issued in 1953 for the State of Vietnam, which evolved into South Vietnam in 1954. On September 22, 1975, after the fall of Saigon, the currency in South Vietnam was changed to a \"liberation \u0111\u1ed3ng<nowiki>\"</nowiki> worth 500 old Southern \u0111\u1ed3ng. After Vietnam was reunified, the \u0111\u1ed3ng was also unified, on May 3, 1978. One new \u0111\u1ed3ng equalled one Northern \u0111\u1ed3ng or 0.8 Southern \"liberation\" \u0111\u1ed3ng. On September 14, 1985, the \u0111\u1ed3ng was revalued, with the new \u0111\u1ed3ng worth 10 old \u0111\u1ed3ng. This started a cycle of chronic inflation that continued through much of the early 1990s. For earlier modern Vietnamese coins, please see North Vietnamese \u0111\u1ed3ng or South Vietnamese \u0111\u1ed3ng. In 1978, aluminium coins (dated 1976), were introduced in denominations of 1, 2, and 5 h\u00e0o and 1 \u0111\u1ed3ng. The coins were minted by the Berlin mint in the German Democratic Republic and bear the state crest on the obverse and denomination on the reverse. | wikipage: North Vietnamese \u0111\u1ed3ng text: North Vietnamese \u0111\u1ed3ng\n\nThe \u0111\u1ed3ng (; ) was the currency of North Vietnam from 3 November 1946 to 2 May 1978. It was subdivided into 10 \"h\u00e0o\", each itself divided into 10 \"xu\". The first \u0111\u1ed3ng issued by the communists controlling northern Vietnam was introduced on January 31, 1946, and replaced the French Indochinese piastre at par. Two revaluations followed.

Issued by the State Bank of Vietnam, it is represented by the symbol \"\u20ab\". Formerly, it was subdivided into 10 \"h\u00e0o\", which were further subdivided into 10 \"xu\", neither of which are now used. Since 2012 the use of coins has decreased greatly, and since 2014 coins are generally not accepted in retail, but will still be accepted in some, but not all, banks. The word \u0111\u1ed3ng is from the term \"\u0111\u1ed3ng ti\u1ec1n\" (\"money\"), a loanword from the Chinese \"t\u00f3ng qi\u00e1n\" (Traditional Chinese: \u9285\u9322; Simplified Chinese: \u94dc\u94b1). The term refers to Chinese bronze coins used as currency during the dynastic periods of China and Vietnam. The term \"h\u00e0o\" is a loanword from the Chinese \"h\u00e1o\" (Chinese: \u6beb), meaning a tenth of a currency unit. The term \"xu\" comes from French \"sous\" meaning \"penny\". The sign is encoded . In 1946, the Viet Minh government (later to become the government of North Vietnam) introduced its own currency, the \u0111\u1ed3ng, to replace the French Indochinese piastre at par.",

Among iOS 11's changes: the lock screen and Notification Center were combined, allowing all notifications to be displayed directly on the lock screen. The various pages of the Control Center were unified, gaining custom settings and the ability to 3D Touch icons for more options. The App Store received a visual overhaul to focus on editorial content and daily highlights. A \"Files\" file manager app allowed direct access to files stored locally and in cloud services. Siri was updated to translate between languages and use a privacy-minded \"on-device learning\" technique to better understand a user's interests and offer suggestions. The camera had new settings for improved portrait-mode photos and utilised new encoding technologies to reduce file sizes on newer devices. In a later release, Messages was integrated with iCloud to better synchronize messages across iOS and macOS devices.
